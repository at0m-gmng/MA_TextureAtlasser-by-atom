### What's new
Texture, material, and mesh files now update their parameters when re-exporting, keeping links to files already in use

### Description
Texture atlas creator tool for Unity. <br> This tool is made to combine textures and/or remap the UVâ€™s for 3D models. The tool can also be used to make 2D sprite sheets. The visual editor gives you the ability to set and prioritize the sizes and positions in the texture atlas/sprite sheet.
- Combine textures/sprites.
- Automatically adjusts the UV's of the assigned meshes to match the new texture atlas.
